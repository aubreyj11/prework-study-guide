# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description 

This webpage is a study guide designed for anyone going through the bootcamp or prework lessons. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Git. My motivation to build this site was to give myself a place to always look back on no matter where I am in my career so I can see my progress and add more notes as time goes on. The problem this website solves is when students wonder where they are going to keep all of their notes. They will be here! I learned that while each language is different, they all build off each other and go hand in hand when creating a working website.
